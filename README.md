# INVERSE
A simple proof of concept game made with my racasting engine (as well as processing's built in engine) just to see that I could do it

This project is an extension of my previous raymarching projects, it is a proof of concept game that I like to call INVERSE, since the viewer has 
inverse sight (i.e. you can see things in the shadows of objects, but not in your line of sight). It has a simple key and door system and only one 
level. Currently getting the key and unlocking the door doesn't do anything, but I will be adding more levels in the future. Thanks for looking!

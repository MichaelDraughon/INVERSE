# INVERSE
A simple proof of concept game made with my racasting engine (as well as processing's built in engine) just to see that I could do it

This project is an extension of my previous raymarching projects, it is a proof of concept game that I like to call INVERSE, since the viewer has 
inverse sight (i.e. you can see things in the shadows of objects, but not in your line of sight). It has a simple key and door system and only one 
level. Currently getting the key and unlocking the door doesn't do anything, but I will be adding more levels in the future. Thanks for looking!


How to play:
Your character is the red dot on the screen, and anything in grey is your "sight", the golden box is the key, and the brown rectangle is the door. You must navigate using the arrow keys to the key, and then to the door. After that you have "won" the game, although nothing happens currently after that. More levels will be added in the future.
